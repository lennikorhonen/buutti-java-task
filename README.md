# Buutti java task
## File copy program
Copies characters from input file to output file

## To run via cli
- Clone git repository
- cd to cloned folder
- Compile program: `javac src/com/company/Main.java`
- Run with `java -cp ./src com.company.Main`
- Program asks for amount of characters in file to copy (Haven't found a way for threads to actually wait for each other so this is a workaround)
- New file can be found in same directory as outputfile.txt

## To run with IDE
- Clone git repository
- Import to IDE of your choice (eg. Eclipse, Intellij Idea)
- Click run in your IDE
- Program asks for amount of characters in file to copy (Haven't found a way for threads to actually wait for each other so this is a workaround)
